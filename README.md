# JavaEE Web POS System

## Overview

The âœ… **Jakarta EE Web POS System** is a robust Point of Sale (POS) application designed specifically for a Food-City. This system aims to streamline the management of customer orders, inventory, and transactions, ensuring efficient operations. The frontend is built with modern web technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, to provide a responsive and user-friendly interface. The backend leverages Jakarta EE for enterprise-level Java capabilities to handle business logic, database interactions, and server communication.

## Project Structure

The project adheres to best practices in software development, employing a layered architecture to ensure a clean separation of concerns. This approach promotes maintainability, scalability, and ease of understanding by dividing the system into distinct layers, such as presentation, business logic, and data access.

### Key Directories

- `src/main/java/`: Contains the core Java code, including DAO, DTO, service, and servlet layers.
- `src/main/webapp/`: Includes configuration files like `web.xml` and `context.xml`.
